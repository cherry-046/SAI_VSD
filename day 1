Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis  

Welcome to Day 1 of the RTL Workshop:  
Today, you will start your journey into digital design by learning Verilog, open-source simulation with Icarus Verilog (iverilog), and the basics of logic synthesis using Yosys.  

This guide contains practical labs, essential concepts, and detailed explanations to help you build a strong foundation in RTL design.

1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?
Simulator:  
A simulator is a tool that checks your digital circuit’s functionality by applying test inputs and observing outputs.  
✅ It helps you verify the design before hardware implementation.  
Design:  
The design is your Verilog code describing the intended digital logic.  
Testbench:  
A testbench is a simulation environment that applies inputs to your design and checks if outputs are correct.  

 2. Getting Started with iverilog  

`iverilog` is an **open-source Verilog simulator**.  
  Simulation Flow:
- Provide design + testbench as inputs to `iverilog`.  
- The simulator produces a `.vcd` file.  
- View waveforms in **GTKWave**.  


 3. Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer  

 🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
🔹step 2:
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
🔹Step 3: Simulate the Design

Compile design + testbench:

iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v


Run simulation:

./a.out


View waveform:

gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd

4. Verilog Code Analysis

good_mux.v:

module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule

🔎 How It Works:

Inputs: i0, i1 (data), sel (select line)

Output: y (selected output)

Logic: If sel=1, y=i1; if sel=0, y=i0.

5. Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries
What is Yosys?

Yosys is an open-source synthesis tool that converts Verilog into a gate-level netlist.

Key Features:

Synthesis: HDL → Logic

Optimization: Speed / Area

Technology Mapping: Uses real gate libraries

Verification: Ensures correctness

Why Multiple Gate Flavors in Libraries?

A .lib file has different versions of the same gate:

Performance: Faster gates for critical paths

Power: Low-power gates for energy efficiency

Area: Compact gates for smaller designs

Drive Strength: Stronger gates for higher loads

Signal Integrity: Specialized gates for noise control

6. Synthesis Lab with Yosys
Step 1: Start Yosys
yosys

Step 2: Read the Library
read_liberty -lib /address/to/your/sky130/file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

Step 3: Read the Verilog Code
read_verilog /home/vsduser/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/good_mux.v

Step 4: Run Synthesis
synth -top good_mux

Step 5: Map to Technology
abc -liberty /address/to/your/sky130/file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

Step 6: View Gate-level Netlist
