### Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) Results

*GLS Tool:* Icarus Verilog  
*Test Vectors Applied:* 3 comprehensive test cases  
*Simulation Duration:* 200 time units  

*Test Case Results:*
- *Test 1:* Input = 8'h0A (10) → Output = 8'h15 (21) ✅ PASS
- *Test 2:* Input = 8'h1F (31) → Output = 8'h3F (63) ✅ PASS  
- *Test 3:* Input = 8'h08 (8) → Output = 8'h11 (17) ✅ PASS

*GLS Waveform Observations:*
- All control signals (valid_out, ready) transition correctly
- Data outputs appear after expected clock cycles
- No timing violations detected
- Gate propagation delays properly modeled

### Functional vs GLS Comparison

*VERIFICATION RESULT: ✅ FULLY MATCHING*

| Aspect | Functional Simulation | Gate-Level Simulation | Status |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Output Values | 21, 63, 17 | 21, 63, 17 | ✅ Match |
| Control Timing | 2-cycle latency | 2-cycle latency | ✅ Match |
| Reset Behavior | Immediate clear | Immediate clear | ✅ Match |
| State Transitions | IDLE→PROCESS→DONE | IDLE→PROCESS→DONE | ✅ Match |

*Comparison Summary:*
The Gate-Level Simulation outputs perfectly match the functional simulation results, confirming that:
- The synthesized netlist maintains correct logical functionality
- No functional errors were introduced during synthesis
- Timing behavior is consistent with design specifications
- All test cases produce identical results in both simulations

### Key Findings

1. *Functional Equivalence:* The synthesized gate-level netlist behaves identically to the RTL design
2. *Timing Accuracy:* GLS provides more realistic timing information including gate delays
3. *Design Integrity:* Synthesis process preserved the intended functionality without corruption
4. *Verification Complete:* BabySoC design is verified at both RTL and gate levels
